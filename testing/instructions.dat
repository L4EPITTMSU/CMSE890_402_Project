Instructions for Use:

Replace 'your_script_name' with the actual names of your Python script files.

Ensure you have the test data files (data1.txt, contour_data1.csv, etc.) in the same directory as your scripts or update the file paths in the test cases accordingly.

Run these test scripts using Python. They should automatically execute the tests defined in them.
