# My Plot Contour Function

The plot_contour function generates and saves a contour plot based on the provided dataset. This function is useful in visualizing three-dimensional data in a two-dimensional plane.



## Parameters

- data (np.ndarray): A NumPy array containing the data to be plotted. It is expected to include x, y, and z values, where x and y are the coordinates, and z is the value to be contoured.

- title (str): The title of the plot, which will appear at the top of the graph.

- cmap (str): The colormap used for the contour plot. This string should correspond to one of Matplotlib's available colormaps.

- output_file (str): The path, including the filename, where the plot will be saved. This should include the file extension, such as .png or .jpg.

## Returns

- None: The function does not return a value. It creates and saves a contour plot.

## Example

import numpy as np

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plot_contour(data, 'Sample Contour Plot', 'viridis', 'output/contour_plot.png')
